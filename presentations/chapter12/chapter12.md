### **Chapter 12: Console Input/Output**

---

#### **Overview:**
Chapter 12 focuses on the foundational concepts of Console Input/Output (I/O) in the CP/M assembly language programming environment. It introduces methods to handle user input and program output through simple, reusable building blocks. These techniques form the backbone of interaction between the program and the user.

---

#### **Key Concepts and Definitions:**

1. **Program Building Blocks:**
   - The chapter introduces modular programming, breaking tasks into manageable, reusable components.
   - Example routines include basic input and output functions for interacting with the console.

2. **CI: (Console Input)**
   - Handles user input from the keyboard.
   - Waits for a character, retrieves it, and makes it available for processing.
   - Handles special characters like backspace and return appropriately.

3. **CO: (Console Output)**
   - Sends a character to the console display.
   - Handles cursor positioning and formatting automatically.
   - Capable of processing printable characters and control characters.

4. **A Simple Test Program:**
   - A demonstration program integrates `CI:` and `CO:` routines.
   - Explains how these routines interact with each other to form a basic console I/O system.
   - Includes examples to read characters from the console and display them back.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Process for Console I/O:**

1. **Console Input Routine (CI):**
   - Polls the keyboard until a character is available.
   - Reads the character from the console and returns it to the program.
   - Handles backspace (`\b`) to allow users to delete input.
   - Supports newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) for text input handling.

2. **Console Output Routine (CO):**
   - Sends characters to the console for display.
   - Includes logic for handling non-printable control characters like newline (`\n`).
   - Formats output text neatly on the console.

3. **Assembling the Test Program:**
   - Create source code for `CI:` and `CO:`.
   - Assemble the program using the CP/M assembler.
   - Link and execute to verify functionality.

---

#### **Notes on the Source Code Listing:**
- The source code provided illustrates the internal workings of `CI:` and `CO:` routines.
- Uses the CP/M system calls (BIOS/BDOS functions) for hardware-agnostic input/output handling.
- Highlights key registers used:
  - **Register A:** For input/output data transfer.
  - **Registers B and C:** For passing function codes to CP/M BIOS calls.

---

#### **Advanced Usage with the Editor (ED):**
- The chapter revisits the CP/M editor (`ED`) to refine and debug the I/O routines.
- Encourages users to edit source code for better readability and error handling.
- Explains the significance of comments in assembly code for long-term maintenance.

---

#### **Testing the Program:**
1. **Steps for Testing:**
   - Load the assembled program into memory using CP/M's `LOAD` utility.
   - Run the program and test for expected behavior (e.g., displaying characters, handling input).
   - Validate edge cases, such as pressing backspace or entering special characters.

2. **Debugging with DDT:**
   - Use the Dynamic Debugging Tool (DDT) to step through code execution.
   - Set breakpoints and inspect register values during program runtime.
   - Adjust code as necessary based on testing results.

---

#### **Expanded Editor Usage:**
- Explores additional features of `ED`, such as:
  - Searching and replacing text in source files.
  - Navigating and editing large source code files effectively.
- Emphasizes the importance of frequent testing and incremental improvements to the program.

---

#### **Practical Applications:**
- Provides a foundation for handling user input and displaying output.
- Essential for developing interactive CP/M programs.
- Forms the basis for more complex input/output operations discussed in later chapters.

---

#### **Key Takeaways:**
- Console I/O is fundamental for program interaction.
- Modular routines (`CI:` and `CO:`) improve reusability and maintainability.
- Effective use of CP/M utilities (`ASM`, `LOAD`, `DDT`, `ED`) ensures efficient program development.
