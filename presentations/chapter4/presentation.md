# File Extensions Overview

## .com
- **Purpose**: A command file or executable file format in DOS. It's a simple, binary executable.
- **Usage**: These files are often small programs or utilities, particularly in older operating systems like MS-DOS.

---

## .asm
- **Purpose**: An assembly language source code file.
- **Usage**: Contains low-level instructions written in assembly language, which are compiled into machine code for execution.

---

## .hex
- **Purpose**: A hexadecimal file, often used in programming embedded systems.
- **Usage**: Contains machine-readable code in hexadecimal format, usually for flashing firmware onto microcontrollers or other devices.

---

## .prn
- **Purpose**: A print file or printer output file.
- **Usage**: Contains data formatted for printing, often used as an intermediary step between a document and the actual printer.

---

## .bak
- **Purpose**: A backup file.
- **Usage**: Automatically generated by software when changes are made to a file, saving a previous version as a `.bak` file.

---

## .$$$
- **Purpose**: A temporary file.
- **Usage**: Created by programs as placeholders or backups while processing data. These files are usually deleted after the program finishes.

---

## .sub
- **Purpose**: A subtitle file.
- **Usage**: Contains subtitles for video files, often used in conjunction with media players to display text alongside the video content. Sometimes `.sub` files can also refer to data related to DVD images.

---

## .Basic
- **Purpose**: A BASIC programming language source file.
- **Usage**: Contains code written in the BASIC programming language (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). This language was widely used in early computing and for educational purposes.

---

## .int
- **Purpose**: An intermediate file or interface file.
- **Usage**: Often used in programming languages like Pascal or Delphi, `.int` files may represent intermediate code generated during the compilation process. In some cases, it can also refer to interface definition files in APIs.

---

## .for
- **Purpose**: A Fortran source code file.
- **Usage**: Contains code written in the Fortran programming language, primarily used for scientific and engineering computations. The `.for` extension is one of several common extensions for Fortran files.

---

## .mac
- **Purpose**: A macro file.
- **Usage**: Typically contains macros, which are sets of instructions or code that automate tasks in programming or applications. Macro files are often associated with assembly language, where they define reusable sets of instructions.

---

## .rel
- **Purpose**: A relocatable object file.
- **Usage**: This file is generated after the assembly or compilation of source code. It contains machine code that can be linked to form the final executable, with the code still relocatable, meaning it can be moved to different memory addresses.

---

## .dat
- **Purpose**: A data file.
- **Usage**: Contains generic data and can be used by various programs to store information in binary or text form. The actual contents of a `.dat` file depend on the program that created it.
